4.2 FUTURE WORK

In future work for a database management system (DBMS) project for a social networking site, a key area of focus could be on implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance user experiences. By leveraging AI and ML, the DBMS can provide personalized content recommendations, intelligent search capabilities, sentiment analysis, and user behavior predictions. These technologies can significantly improve user engagement, satisfaction, and the overall quality of interactions within the social networking site, making it more dynamic and tailored to individual users' preferences and interests.
