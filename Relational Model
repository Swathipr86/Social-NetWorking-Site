3.1 Database languages
Four categories of database languages :
1. Data definition language (DDL)
Data definition language (DDL) creates the framework of the database by specifying the database schema, which is the structure that represents the organization of data. Its common uses include the creation and alteration of tables, files, indexes and columns within the database. This language also allows users to rename or drop the existing database or its components. 
Here's a list of DDL statements:
•  CREATE: Creates a new database or object, such as a table, index or column.
•  ALTER: Changes the structure of the database or object.
•  DROP: Deletes the database or existing objects.
•  RENAME: Renames the database or existing objects.

2. Data manipulation language (DML)
Data manipulation language (DML) provides operations that handle user requests, offering a way to access and manipulate the data that users store within a database. Its common functions include inserting, updating and retrieving data from the database. 
Here's a list of DML statements:
•  INSERT: Adds new data to the existing database table.
•  UPDATE: Changes or updates values in the table.
•  DELETE: Removes records or rows from the table.
•  SELECT: Retrieves data from the table or multiple tables.

3. Data control language (DCL)
Data control language (DCL) controls access to the data that users store within a database. Essentially, this language controls the rights and permissions of the database system. It allows users to grant or revoke privileges to the database.
 Here's a list of DCL statements:
•  GRANT: Gives a user access to the database.
•  REVOKE: Removes a user's access to the database.
4. Transaction control language (TCL)
Transaction control language (TCL) manages the transactions within a database. Transactions group a set of related tasks into a single, executable task. All the tasks must succeed in order for the transaction to work. Here's a list of TCL statements:
•  COMMIT: Carries out a transaction.
•  ROLLBACK: Restores a transaction if any tasks fail to execute.

3.2 Table Description
Following are the tables along with constraints used in Social Networking Site database.
1.Customer: The "Customer" table stores customer information with ID, name, email, password, and registration date, utilizing integer, varchar, and date data types. The ID column is the primary key.
Constraint: The "Customer" table enforces constraints such as primary key for "cid" and non-null requirements for "cname", "cemail", "password", and "registration_date" columns.
